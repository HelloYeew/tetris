1. If you are coding on final project, and you are here, just don't be a dick.

   Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

   - 1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy the original work/works and change the name or why you did it. 
   - 1b. Copying the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick and make you a DICK programmer. 
   - 1c. Modifying the original work, add "Hello World!" and send. That would make you a PROPER dick. Maybe you are more HELLO HELL more than hello world.
   - 1d. Copy this code to use it for your final project group, that's make you a MOST DUMB dick.

3. If you get full score through modification this and send as a final project for your group, look this as a GOOD fucking reference, go code your final project with this open on the other side of the screen. Only a dick would copy this work and make it to pass this course with a full score and don't know fucking thing about the original work and the fucking design pattern.

4. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes
   you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back or submit a [bug report,](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html) but I know you are not do it because you don't want to get F for this course.

5. If you copy this for your final project in SSD 2022, what the fuck do you want? You're a bigger dick that you think. Do your work or get fucked.
